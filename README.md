# 🤟 HandiTalk — Beyond Accessibility

> **"Tunisia is an Experience. Don't just see it. Feel it."**

HandiTalk is an emotionally immersive travel platform designed to bridge the communication gap for the 466 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide. We believe that travel is a human right, and communication is the key to unlocking the soul of a destination.

## ✨ The Vision: "Warm Human Tech"
HandiTalk rejects the "cold" aesthetic of traditional accessibility tools. Instead, we use a **Warm Tech** design system:
- **Soft Aesthetics**: A palette of Blush, Rose, and Gold that feels human and welcoming.
- **Micro-Animations**: Silky transitions that make the technology feel alive and responsive.
- **Emotional Arc**: A landing page designed as a cinematic journey—from the isolation of "The Silence Barrier" to the empowerment of "The AI Suite."
